A project I made in collaboration with JumboCast, Tufts' student sports broadcasting club. 
It pulls data from the tufts website, or any other NESCAC team for that matter, and provides
analysis based on user preference. Making use of pandas and beautiful soup, it was a great 
python learning project. Instructions are all within the code. Hockey, soccer, and volleyball
are currently the only three implemented sports, with hockey being NHL specific and soccer
and volleyball carrying out the main intended purpose of the code; NESCAC stats.
