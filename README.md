# 📊 StatBot  
*A collaborative project with Tufts' Student Broadcasting Club, JumboCast*  

StatBot is a Python-based interactive CLI tool designed to streamline **sports research and stat lookups** for Tufts broadcasters. By scraping official athletics sites and presenting stats in a structured, queryable format, StatBot helps JumboCast broadcasters prepare faster and smarter for game coverage.  

---

## 🚀 Features  

- **Interactive CLI**  
  - Choose a sport (Soccer, Volleyball, Hockey, etc.).  
  - Explore team, offense, defense, or goalie stats.  
  - Query by player, by stat, or by conditions (e.g., "players with more than 5 G").  

- **Supported Sports**  
  - ✅ **Volleyball** (team, offense, defense stats)  
  - ✅ **Soccer** (team, offense, goalie stats)  
  - ✅ **Hockey** (NHL draft data by year)  
  - 🚧 **Basketball, Football, Baseball** (placeholders for future development)  

- **Flexible Data Queries**  
  - Player-specific summaries  
  - Stat-based summaries (e.g., goals, assists, saves)  
  - Conditional searches (`MAX`, `MIN`, `GREATER`, `LESS`)  

- **Data Cleaning**  
  - Automatically splits player names into `FirstName` and `LastName`  
  - Converts numeric stats into float values for easy comparison

## ▶️ Usage

Run StatBot in your terminal:

```bash
python statbot.py
```

Example interaction:

```
Hi, I'm Statbot!
Enter the first letter of the sport you're looking for, 
BB for basketball, or any other input to end your session
> S
Would you like to look at team(T), offence(O), or goalie(G) stats?
> O
Would you like to look at overall stats or conference stats?
> O
```

Then you can query the dataset:

```
For conditional search, type C followed by what you'd like to search for,
eg. "players with more than 5 G" or "player with the most A"
> C players with more than 10 G
```
